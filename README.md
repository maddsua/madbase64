# madbase64
## A Lightning-fast singe-header base64 encoder/decoder written in C

## New versions (C++) [moved here](https://github.com/maddsua/lambda/blob/main/src/base64.cpp)

## The purpose:

Encoding/decoding large sizes binary data. Yes, binary. I mean files, images and actually anything

**Why?**

Stackoverflow solutions are just garbage. No, really. Just look at that endless std::string pushbacks and countless temp buffers.

This one could be one of the fastest base64 enc/decoder implementation. Or it's the dumbest one. Need your feedback to tell!

**Pros**
- 🚀 Achieves speeds over 100 MB/s at a single thred of AMD Ryzen 3600
- 🚀 No I'm serious, it's fast
- ✨ Straight-forward algorythm, no additional buffers and other nonsence
- 👌 Tested in my other projects

**Cons**
- 💣 Probably some explosive bugs (didn't find any yet)
- 😡 Makes python and JS devs cry
